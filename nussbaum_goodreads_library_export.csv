The premise was so interesting, and the story was well executed. It was a great combination of twists I didn’t see coming as well as story lines I could theorize about and figure out. There were two small drawbacks for me... I felt that the beginning was a bit slow, given that the audience knows more than the protagonists, and the main character repeated himself a lot, but those were so minor relative to the complexity that I’m willing to forgive. A great book... read it with my boyfriend and we really enjoyed sharing our theories with each other as the story progressed. Definitely would recommend!",,,1,1

However, I also don’t think it’s a bad story—rather, Boyne tells the story so well that you’re left with a mix of pity and revulsion for almost all of the major characters. You spend the entire book waiting for the new and terrible things that will inevitably come at you. I hated, HATED Maurice Swift. He was awful. But was the writing bad if the book makes you feel powerful, albeit negative emotions?<br/><br/>Ultimately, I don’t think I can truly judge the book of what I felt about it.

The writing was decent, but some phrases were a little tiresome after hearing them several times. This book is also split between two stories, but the dominant one got to be a bit much and I wish the distribution had been more even... I was much more interested in the present day events. Regardless, this was an engaging read and I did find myself wanting to know what was going to happen next in the story... would definitely recommend more of this author, even if it’s not this particular book.",,,1,1
